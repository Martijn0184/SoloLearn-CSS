    <p><img src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/css_logo.png" alt="SoloLearn logo">This paragraph has an image that is
        floated to the <b>right</b>. It is highly recommended to add a margin to images so that the text does not get to
        close to the image. If you want your text to be easily read, you should always read, you should always add a few
        pixels between words and borders, images and other content.</p>
    <p class="yel">Elements are floated horizontally, meaning that an element can only be floated left or right, NOT up or down.</p>
