        This text inside the div element, which has a blue background color and is floated to the left. We set a

    <h2>auto</h2>
    <div class="auto">
        This text inside the div element, which has a blue background color and is floated to the left. We set a
        specific height and width for the div element, and as you can see, the content fit because the overflow property
        is set to auto.

    <h2>hidden</h2>
    <div class="hidden">
        This text inside the div element, which has a blue background color and is floated to the left. We set a
        specific height and width for the div element, and as you can see, the content cannot fit because the overflow
